            <h2>Who We Are?</h2>
            <p>Our story began in 2004. It was here the company opened its first office in Markham, Ontario as a consulting associate offering services in an integrated healthcare area for our customers. Our name was inspired by the star cluster “CYG” that shines brightly in X-rays, and “LERA” (Lyra) one of the brightest stars, thus the name “Cyglera”.

                Three years later, the visionary CEO Mick Majid became captivated with the evolving healthcare technology for Electronic Health Records Management systems. In 2007, our first EHR software, “Chart Star”, was launched. It was a complete electronic health record management system for Primary Care physicians and medical clinics. Cyglera was able to implement Chart Star into small to mid-size medical clinics across the country. In 2008, we implemented its largest technology infrastructure into a new multi-discipline primary care, specialty, and diagnostic imaging health center. Cyglera established itself as a healthcare technology company.

                We would soon realize the needed to focus on the human spirit to benefit directly from the medical technology and advance the healthcare delivery. Over the next few years, Cyglera researched and looked at the various needs of the healthcare landscape and its staff, and how they could benefit from advancements in technology.
                
                In 2017, we began to recognize the impact on our healthcare system caused by the increasing adoption of unhealthy lifestyles in the general population, leading to greater numbers of hospital admission and diagnosed illnesses. We embarked on building a much-needed digital technology to help anyone and everyone achieve a healthier lifestyle and better health. During this time, we have also expanded our presence into Buffalo, New York to focus on preventable lifestyle diseases on both sides of the border.</p>
